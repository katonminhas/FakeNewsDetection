# FakeNewsDetection

This project uses the University of Victoria ISOT fake news dataset (https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php)

The goal was to develop a system to classify news as real or fake using stylistic features extracted from text using NLP techniques and sentiment analysis

Models relying on headline features alone achieved ~73% accuracy, models using full article text achieved ~76% accuracy
Models using features from both headlines and article text achieved ~82% accuracy

The project paper Fake-News-Detection.pdf contains further research and background, as well as a more detailed description of the models
